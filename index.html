	<h2 class="Header">Uber Data Analysis Project</h2>
		<p class="Paragraph">This study is based entirely on the results of an 8-month period (from May 2017 - December 2017) project in which a simple survey along with the recorded data from an independent contractor’s mobile application (Uber partner/driver app) brought together my study’s main dataset. I personally collected this information by asking the passengers the following questions: “Where are you from originally?” and “What do you like the most about San Diego?”. The intention of this study is to compile, visualize and interpret data in order to learn what aspect of the City of San Diego, California individuals considered to be the most appealing. </p>

When the data exploration and cleaninsing phase of my analysis was completed during 2018, the appealing aspects were categorized as the following: W (weather), P (people), O (other) and N/A. In addition, other applications such as Tableau Public and some Microsoft Office tools were used to complete this study.</p>

<div class="Automation_Project">
	<h2 class="Header">Text File Comparer Automation Project</h2>
		<p class="Paragraph">The author came up with the idea after observing that data delivered on a quarterly basis followed identical trends. One out of the several tasks as a Data Analyst was to compare several text files by manually manipulating data on Microsoft Excel (spreadsheet) prior to updating a mobile application known as <em>Market Metrics</em>. At the beginning of each quarter, some clients would deliver a list of their ‘Broker Dealer Exclusion IDs’ or ‘BDE IDs’ that were related to certain data/transactions that each client did not want to see in their account linked with the mobile app. As part of the process, these lists (or txt files) containing the BDE IDs were compared to those lists submitted by each iPad client during the previous quarter. This was manually done by aligning each column of data and inserting a 3rd column with boolean datatype (True or False).

	</div><br>
		<p class="Paragraph">This process may not seem too difficult and it may not require advanced knowledge in Microsoft Excel, however, it is time consuming and unnecessary. There is no denying that most technical processes are still required to be performed by humans, but it is both more time and resource efficient to have a Python script or code that can handle copying and pasting large amounts of data from different paths (with several folders within), and display the results in a matter of seconds!

		<p class="Paragraph">The following section will include images of some objects that were designed by the author with solid modeling software. Modern mechanical and aerospace engineers, industrial designers, technical draftsman and even hobbyists use this type of applications to create objects that are commonly seen in our daily lives. Although there are many applications that serve the same purpose, the only ones that have been used by the author are the following: Creo Parametric, SolidWorks and Fussion 360. By definition, isometric view is when the drawing of an object has all of its lines set to have a 30 degree angle with respect to their axis; meaning that a drawing of an object is slightly shifted so that it could look like a 3D object instead of a 2D drawing. Exploded view refers to an assembly (group of parts that forms an object/machine/tool) that has all of it's components separated at a distance relative to each other or to its origin an xyz cartesian system.</p>

<div class="Bio_Photonic">
	<h2 class="Header">The Bio-inspired Glucose Detector</h2>
		<p class="Paragraph">This was our final senior project for an Optics course and it made us physically interpret what the given Matlab code was displaying. Our job was to modify some aspects of the code and understand the way light traveled throughout a photonic crystal, so we could hypothetically invent a sensor that works by using these principles to measure the amount of glucose contained within any substance. We came up with the idea of a small device that had its surface covered with aluminum-oxide barbs (or tiny cylinders like ones from the image below). The picture represents the microscopic structure of a Peacock's feather. Unfortunately, we don't have an image of the hypothetical device, however, we concluded that the greater the angle in which light got bend in presence of the sensor's barbs, implied that the more glucose was contained in whatever substance (or solution). Note: This project does not include an extra link.</p>

	<h2 class="Header">The Growth Rate of Plants Over Small Surfaces/Volumes</h2>
		<p class="Paragraph">My non-supervised and discontinued project allowed me to apply different concepts related with: Calculus, Physics, Biology; and mostly First-Degree and Separable Elementary Differential Equations. The objective of the formula below was intended to predict how much time will these organisms live in small spaces. This project is based on the author's theory that a plant's lifespan can be predicted based on the exacts amount of water and a limited space. Please note that the parentheses represents multiplication. The notation below was written in LaTeX. Note: This project does not include an extra link.</p>
