	<h2 class="Header">Uber Data Analysis Project</h2>
		<p class="Paragraph">This study is based entirely on the results of an 8-month (from May 2017 - December 2017) project in which a simple survey along with the recorded data from an independent contractor’s mobile application (Uber partner/driver app) brought together my study’s main dataset. I personally collected this information by asking the passengers the following questions: <em>“Where are you from originally?”</em> and <em>“What do you like the most about San Diego?”</em>. The intention of this study is to compile, visualize and interpret data in order to learn what aspect of the City of San Diego individuals consider to be the most appealing. </p>

When both, the data exploration and cleansing phases of my analysis were completed during 2018, the appealing aspects were categorized as the following: W (weather), P (people), O (other) and N/A. In addition, other applications such as Tableau Public and some Microsoft Office tools were used to complete this study.</p>

<div class="Automation_Project">
	<h2 class="Header">Text File Comparer Automation Project</h2>
		<p class="Paragraph">This idea was developed after observing that data delivered on a quarterly basis followed identical trends. One of the tasks as a Data Analyst, was to compare several text files by manually manipulating data on Microsoft Excel (spreadsheet) prior to updating a mobile application known as <em>Market Metrics</em>. At the beginning of each quarter, some clients would deliver a list of their ‘Broker Dealer Exclusion IDs’ or ‘BDE IDs’. These IDs are directly linked to certain transactions that ocurred during the quarter. Each client had the benefit to select which Broker Dealers were going to get excluded on a quarterly basis. Once exclusions were applied, the client could not see (through the mobile app) those transactions linked with the BDE ID's. As part of the process, these lists (or txt files) containing the BDE IDs were compared to those lists submitted by each iPad client during the previous quarter. This was manually done by aligning each column of data and inserting a 3rd column with boolean datatype (True or False).

		<p class="Paragraph">This process may not seem too difficult and it may not require advanced knowledge in Microsoft Excel, however, it is time consuming and unnecessary. There is no denying that most technical processes are still required to be performed by humans, but it is both more time and resource efficient to have a Python script or code that can handle copying and pasting large amounts of data from different paths (with several folders within), and display the results in a matter of seconds!

	<h2 class="Header">Three-D Computer Aided Design (CAD) Designs</h2>
		<p class="Paragraph">The following section contains images of some mechanical devices that were designed by myself with solid modeling software. Modern mechanical and aerospace engineers, industrial designers, technical draftsman and even hobbyists use these types of applications to create objects that are commonly seen in our daily lives. I currently have experience with the following: Creo Parametric, SolidWorks and Fussion 360. By definition, isometric view is when the drawing of an object has all of its lines set to have a 30 degree angle with respect to their axis; meaning that a drawing of an object is slightly shifted so that it looks like a 3D object instead of a 2D drawing. Exploded view refers to an assembly (group of parts that form an object/machine/tool) that has all of its components separated at a distance relative to each other or to its origin in the xyz-cartesian system.</p>

<div class="Bio_Photonic">
	<h2 class="Header">The Bio-inspired Glucose Detector</h2>
		<p class="Paragraph">This was our final senior project for an Optics course at San Diego State University. The objective was to physically interpret what the given Matlab code was displaying. The next step was to modify some aspects of the code in order to understand the way light traveled throughout a photonic crystal. Our goal was to design a sensor. This sensor or device contains the modified Matlab script embeddeb within, with the goal of measuring the amount of glucose contained in any substance. We came up with the idea of a small device that had its surface covered with aluminum-oxide barbs. The sensor is similar to the microscopic structure of a Peacock's feather (which contains photonic crystals), that refracts light as the angle and position of the feather changes. Unfortunately, we don't have an image of the hypothetical device, however, we concluded that the greater the angle in which light got bent in presence of the sensor's barbs, the more glucose was contained in whatever substance (or solution). Note: This project does not include an extra link.</p>

	<h2 class="Header">The Growth Rate of Plants Over Small Surfaces/Volumes</h2>
		<p class="Paragraph">My self-started yet discontinued project allowed me to apply different concepts related with: Calculus, Physics, Biology; and mostly First-Degree and Separable Elementary Differential Equations. The objective of the formula below was intended to predict the lifespan of bean sprouts in small spaces. This project is based on my theory that a plant's lifespan can be predicted based on the exact amount of water and a limited space. Please note that the parentheses represent multiplication. The notation below was written in LaTeX. Note: This project does not include an extra link.</p>
