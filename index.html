			<div class="Data_Analysis">
			<strong>1. Uber Data Analysis Project</strong><br>
				<p>This study is based entirely on the results of an 8-month period (from May 2017 - December 2017) project in which a simple survey along with the recorded data from an independent contractor’s mobile application (Uber partner/driver app) brought together my study’s main dataset. I personally collected this information by asking the passengers the following questions: “Where are you from originally?” and “What do you like the most about San Diego?”. The intention of this study is to compile, visualize and interpret data in order to learn what aspect of the City of San Diego, California individuals considered to be the most appealing. </p>
				<p>Extra Note:
				<br>I didn't create the images below nor any other related pictures contained within my project that were directly obtained from Uber's websites.</p>

			<div class="Dice">
			<strong>2. Dice Sum Chart</strong><br>
				<p>This code was written in Java (programming language), and it rolls 2 dice, each labeled as die 1 and 2, three million times and displays a chart showing the number of times we obtained a sum from each face. The row and column numbered from 1 to 6 represent the pair of dice and the computer will always show different outcomes everytime the program gets runned. So we could either obtain 2,3 or any number until 12, just a few thousand times!</p>

			<strong>3. Airspeed Gauge and Altimeter</strong><br>
				<p>The code (also written in Java) shows how high an airplane is flying and displays 4 out of the 5 different types of speed (doesn't include ground speed) measured in a real aircraft. The code simulates data provided by a "sensor" (the user's input). This mini-project is an example of Applied Mathematics at it's finest! The reason being that Physics' concepts are required in order for the computations to make sense.</p> 
				<p>Extra Note:
				<br>The user must input the air's speed, temperature, air density and ambient pressure.</p>

 			<div class="Survey">
			<strong>4. Marketing Survey</strong><br>
				<p>The goal of this short psychographic survey (written in Java as well) is to learn where people want to travel. This could be used by advertising firms in order to benefit airlines or a country's tourism sector, since this data could allow researchers to have a better understanding of a population's favorite vacation spots.</p>

			<strong>6. The bio-inspired glucose detector based on a photonic crystal</strong><br>
				<p>This was our final senior project for an Optics course and it made us physically interpret what the given Matlab code was displaying. Our job was to modify some aspects of the code and understand the way light traveled throughout the crystal, so we could hypothetically invent a sensor that works by using these principles to measure the amount of glucose contained within any substance. We came up with the idea of a small device that had its surface covered with aluminum-oxide barbs (or tiny cylinders like ones from the image below). The picture represents the microscopic structure of a Peacock's feather. Unfortunately, we don't have an image of the device, however, we concluded that the greater the angle in which light got bend in presence of the sensor's barbs, implied that the more glucose was contained in whatever substance (or solution).</p>

			<strong>7. The Growth Rate of Plants Over Small Surfaces/Volumes</strong><br>
				<p>My non-supervised and discontinued project allowed me to apply different concepts related with: Calculus, Physics, Biology; and mostly First-Degree and Separable Elementary Differential Equations. So far, I was able to develop the formula below, and its goal was to predict how much time will these organisms live.</p>
				<p>Extra Note:
				<br>The parentheses represents multiplication. The notation below was written in LaTeX.</p>
